# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This Repository is created for submitting the allocated task from React JS Day 2 session.

The given task is to create a Price Card using React JS.

Please refer the following files for Source Code:
- index.html
- src/Components/Card.jsx
- src/Components/CardContainer.jsx 
- src/assets/styles/style.css

Thankyou and Awaiting Feedback.
