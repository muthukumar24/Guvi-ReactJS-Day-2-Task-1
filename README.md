# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

================================================================

This Repository is created for submitting the allocated task from React JS Day 2 session.

The given task is to create a Price Card using React JS. I have created an array of datas to create price card, then I have passed the array datas through props and We can add more datas in this array, the price card will be created for the datas available in array. Included Bootstrap for responsiveness across all devices.

Please refer the following files for Source Code:
- index.html
- src/App.jsx
- src/Components/Card.jsx
- src/Components/CardContainer.jsx 
- src/assets/styles/style.css

Thankyou and Awaiting Feedback.
